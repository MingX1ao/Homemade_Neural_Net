# Homemade_Neural_Net
This is a neural net only based on Numpy. It's a project I made to improve my understanding on deep learning.  
The word "homemade" means it is very simple and slow.  
But in my opinion, only if I successfully make my own nn, I'm not get familiar with it.

The myNet file is the main part of the net.  
And the learn_num is the first testing file for the net, I tested myNet through "Holle word" of deep learning, MNIST dataset.
